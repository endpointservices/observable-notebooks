    [WEBCode.run](https://webcode.run) is growing! We have added our first paid feature which will help support it long term. WEBCode is bootstrapped so this is a big milestone!

    For those that do not know, [WEBCode.run](https://webcode.run) allows you to run serverless compute workloads from within [Observable](https://observablehq.com) notebooks. Until now, notebooks containing [WEBCode.run](https://webcode.run) handlers had to be public so that WEBCode's compute layer could read the code. Not anymore! 

    We have added a new feature for Observable [Team](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/getting-started-with-teams) accounts that allows public access to serverless endpoints while keeping the source code private. We feel this feature best suits commercial teams, and thus, is a perfect fit for a paid tier. Find out more on the [webcode.run website](https://webcode.run) or contact [sales@webcode.run](mailto://sales@webcode.run).

    For those that want to use WEBCode to build transparent open source services, they can continue do so at no charge.

    As part of the work in providing a paid tier, we have updated the [website](https://webcode.run) significantly. You can also email me at [tom@webcode.run](mailto://tom@webcode.run)!


    ### Coming soon

    [WEBCode.run](https://webcode.run) enables running HTTP services with excellent performance and observability from within a notebook. In the coming months we will demonstrate why this is an important primitive. [WEBCode.run](https://webcode.run) is a connection technology for something larger, it enables completely self documenting projects to be bundled into a single encapsulated artifact. In the coming months the focus will be on delivering preconfigured artifacts you can one click fork to self-host and customize.

    In our vision of the future, source level customization and self-hosting at the service level is a single click away. This is only possible when the backend and frontend + all the extras (documentation, monitoring) are a single forkable artifact, [WEBCode.run](https://webcode.run) *with* [Observablehq.com](https://observablehq.com) are able to deliver this.  

    ### Support us on Product Hunt

    We are launching the paid tier and [webcode.run](https://webcode.run) on Product Hunt. Help us get to #1 with some love [here](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/webcode-run)
