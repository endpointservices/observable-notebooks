    | To help win a [[Conscription Crisis of 1917|mandate for conscription]] during World War I, the federal [[Conservative Party of Canada (1867–1942)|Conservative]] government of [[Robert Borden]] granted the vote in 1917 to war widows, women serving overseas, and the female relatives of men serving overseas. However, the same legislation, the [[Wartime Elections Act]], disenfranchised those who became naturalized Canadian citizens after 1902. Women over 21 who were "not alien-born" and who met certain property qualifications were allowed to vote in federal elections in 1918.

Individuals can only vote through restricted indirect elections. The right to be elected is also restricted, and people here have essentially never have a complete and rational right to vote.
