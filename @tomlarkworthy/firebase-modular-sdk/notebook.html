    # Firebase Modular SDK

    The [Firebase module SDK collection](https://observablehq.com/collection/@tomlarkworthy/firebase-modular-sdk) enables the use of the modular SDK in the Firebase idiomatic style.

    In Firebase the [quickstart](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/start) the documentation states the following

    ```js
    import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
    import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";

    // TODO: Replace the following with your app's Firebase project configuration
    // See: https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/learn-more#config-object
    const firebaseConfig = {
      // ...
    };

    // Initialize Firebase
    const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);


    // Initialize Firebase Authentication and get a reference to the service
    const auth = getAuth(app);
    ```

    However, the destructuring ES6 module import is not available in Observable so that code will not run. To fix this, the module SDK collection defines a number of notebooks as equivalents for the underlying Firebase modules. Destructuring *is* available when importing notebooks, so the imports in the above code can be rewritten and the overall code block will now work

    ```js
    import { initializeApp } from "@tomlarkworthy/firebase-app";
    import { getAuth } from "@tomlarkworthy/firebase-auth";
    ```

    ## Advantages of the Modular SDK

    The earlier version of bringing Firebase to Observable ended loading all packages, which was over 1MB of JavaScript, of which, most was Firestore due to its underlying gRPC-web transport. This manifested itself as slow page load times. With the modular SDK only Javascript you need can be loaded, and the resultant code is tree shakeable for even more code size reductions.

    ## Code generated

    The notebook https://observablehq.com/@tomlarkworthy/paste-codegen was used to help auto generate the notebook collection

    ## Minified

    Some of the libraries have been minified (they have an attachment)
    ~~~js
    #!/usr/bin/env node
    require('esbuild').build({
      entryPoints: ['firebase-auth.js'],
      bundle: true,
      minify: true,
      format: 'esm',
      outfile: 'firebase-auth.min.js',
    }).catch(() => process.exit(1))
