    <h1> Pause and Play STEM Activities Book</h1>
    <p style="max-width: 100%;">
    Hey! I am a stay at home mum of twins, previously a scientist. I wrote a book for young kids (ages 3â€“7). The book has simple, graphical instructions on how to set up and play with science activities at home. It allows young children, even without reading skills to decide which science activity they want to explore & to prepare & play with the activities independently. Every science activity is linked to a QR code with an engaging Youtube video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpL1E-yK38HGsNaIfVPdc8w">my channel</a>. The videos offer further insights into the activities through a different types of media. Our science activities only use household items aiming for minimal preparations. The book also includes suggestions on how to extend the activities and kid-friendly scientific explanations. By combining this print book, our Youtube videos, and minimal parental support, we create a holistic, real-life experience allowing young kids to choose, play, and learn science.
