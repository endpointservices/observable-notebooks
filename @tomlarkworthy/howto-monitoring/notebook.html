    # Productionizing Observable Notebooks with 3rd party Active Monitoring
  </script>
  <script id="12" type="text/markdown">
    I keep my [200+ public notebooks](https://observablehq.com/@tomlarkworthy?tab=notebooks) on the [observablehq.com](https://observablehq.com) platform running by actively monitoring them with a 3rd party monitoring tool [uptimerobot](https://uptimerobot.com/?rid=ea2c825277fe40). Here is how I got it connected, and how I did it unobtrusively without altering the original notebooks.

    Broken notebooks are a big problem. I have encountered many broken notebooks on [observablehq.com](https://observablehq.com), and then much later, I have written many more. The thing is, I did not know my old notebooks were broken until I randomly checked! I don't want to host broken notebooks, but I can't be checking 200 notebooks every week, it doesn't scale! Instead, I figured out a way to bring off-the-shelf monitoring solutions to the notebook ecosystem. The best thing is that it can be applied to any notebook. There is no special library or anything to depend upon *etc.*

    ### Using the [Observablehq runtime](https://github.com/observablehq/runtime) to create a [Healthcheck](https://observablehq.com/@endpointservices/healthcheck) Metabook

    Did you know that all notebooks are packed as ES6 modules, and you can run them inside the open-source [Observablehq runtime](https://github.com/observablehq/runtime) programmatically? (see *[Advanced Embedding and Downloading](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/downloading-and-embedding-notebooks)*) This means a notebook can find and run code found in another notebook. I call these types of notebooks *metabooks* as they are higher-order notebooks (notebooks whose input is another notebook).

    So, the [healthcheck metabook](https://observablehq.com/@endpointservices/healthcheck), given a target notebook, runs the target on an internal [Observablehq runtime](https://github.com/observablehq/runtime) and looks for errors.  

    ```js
      const [{ Runtime }, { default: targetNotebook }] = await Promise.all([
        import(
          "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/runtime@4/dist/runtime.js"
        ),
        import(`https://api.observablehq.com/\${settings.target}.js?v=3`)
      ]);
      new Runtime().module(targetNotebook, (name) => {
        // cell observers
        return {
          ...
          rejected(error) {
            // cell threw an error
            ...
          }
        }
      }
    ```

    Using the runtime hooks we can detect if a cell throws an error, which will pick up many common forms of notebook rot. To attach 3rd party monitoring though, this error detector needs to be exposed as a HTTP service for 3rd party consumption.
  </script>
  <script id="77" type="text/markdown">
    ### Exposing a HTTP service with [WEBcode.run](https://webcode.run)

    We use Observable native functions-as-a-service runtime [WEBcode.run](https://webcode.run) to expose an endpoint on the internet.

    With [WEBcode.run](https://webcode.run) you define a handler for *requests* that write back to a *response*. Because it executes in the notebook, you get access to all the notebook functionality. In our case, we decode a target notebook from a URL parameter. The API is modelled after the [Express 4.0 API](http://expressjs.com/en/api.html) (see [req](http://expressjs.com/en/api.html#req), [res](http://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res) for details).

    ```js
    endpoint(
      "default", // For a simple URL we use the default name
      async (req, res) => {
        const target = req.query.target; // Read the target notebook.
        run(target, excludes); // start health checking

        setTimeout(() => {
          // There is no clear stopping point so we just run it for X seconds
          const errors = viewof errors.value; // collect errors
          res.status(errors.length > 0 ? 503 : 200).send(
            JSON.stringify({
              errors: errors.map((e) => ({
                cell: e.cell,
                message: e.error.message
              }))
            }, null,2 )
          );
        }, 5000);
      },
      {
        reusable: false, // This does not support concurrent operations
        modifiers: ["orchistrator"] // This endpoint can call other endpoints
      }
    )
    ```

    Our handler starts the healthcheck process, and after 5 seconds reports, if errors are found.

    So, to check for errors on notebook [@tomlarkworthy/view](https://observablehq.com/@tomlarkworthy/view), we make a request using curl to 

    ```
    curl 'https://webcode.run/observablehq.com/@endpointservices/healthcheck?target=@tomlarkworthy/view'
    ```

    Because 3rd party monitoring tools typically just check HTTP status codes, our handler returns a status code 503 (unavailable) if errors are detected, or 200 (OK) otherwise.

    ### Attaching UptimeRobot

    UptimeRobot is a very simple to use active monitoring service and it will provide 50 monitoring jobs for FREE!

    Active monitoring will poll the provided URL on a schedule, log the status, and alert via email/SMS/webhook if an error code is seen.

    ### Unit tests, Sentry

    Being able to actively monitor my notebooks for errors has completely changed my anxiety levels. By looking at my dashboard I can see that all my main notebooks are running well. As I am building a business upon [Observablehq](https://observablehq.com/), I must keep everything working, so seeing my code has run successfully is reassuring.

    <img width=640px src=${await FileAttachment("image@2.png").url()} />

    The biggest change is that when an error is reported by an end-user, I now convert that issue into a [unit test](https://observablehq.com/@tomlarkworthy/testing). Because unit tests errors are runtime errors, a healthcheck over a notebook containing a test suite will alert on unit test failures. So now I can fairly confidently ensure that particular issues never happen again.

    I also use [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) to automatically report errors, whether generated by user usage, or by healthcheck monitoring (see this [notebook](https://observablehq.com/@endpointservices/sentry-io)). Again, for low usage, [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io) is a FREE service. Sentry compliments [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/?rid=ea2c825277fe40) by logging context around an error, and also it runs in user devices like iPhone which can sometimes have their unique issues.

    I am very excited that we can take a developer-friendly product like [Observablehq](https://observablehq.com/) and still fit it into the existing DevOps infrastructure. It suggests that building high-quality software on [Observable](https://observablehq.com/) is possible, and maybe preferable. I love [Observable](https://observablehq.com/), in that, for all its workflow cleverness, it's still just Javascript running idiomatically in a browser, and thus, we can leverage existing specialist tools that already exist in the ecosystem. There is no need to reinvent the wheel when using Observable! I hope this story helps you get to the reliability levels you want out of your software hosted on [Observablehq](https://observablehq.com/).

    *I tweet lots of Observable stuff at [@tomlarkworthy](https://twitter.com/tomlarkworthy), and occasionally launch things on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/@tomlarkworthy)*
