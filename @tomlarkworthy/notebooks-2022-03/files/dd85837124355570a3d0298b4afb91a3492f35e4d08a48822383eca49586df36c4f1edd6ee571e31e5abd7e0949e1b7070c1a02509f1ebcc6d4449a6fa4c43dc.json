Usage: note Only the variables present when catchAll is called will be tracked, and new cells created afterwards will not be tracked. You can pass an invalidation promise as the 2nd argument to clean up the observers, this is needed if you expect to be calling catchAll more than once.

Below is an example with one interrupted transition followed by a full transition. If you use ` ` to create an easing function `f1` for a transition, and this transition is interrupted at `t`, you can create a seamlessly continuing easing function `f2` with Or, if you want to control the end slope (default is 0): Here's an example of the concept in action.

There are different types of color scales available. Here, we take a look at a rather uncommon color scale, which is mapping a numeric value to two colors and adding also an encoding in length: A two-tone pseudo color scale introduced in paper Two-Tone Pseudo Coloring: Compact Visualization for One-Dimensional Data in 2005.

This page shows how this may be used to create some simple shape-based animated transitions. Start shapes We start with a set of polygon shapes. Some are simple, single polygons ('bird' and 'house'), others comprise multiple polygons ('triangles') or geo-polygons ('londonCoords').
