    # Interactive Sequence Diagrams

    I am pleased to discover the Mermaid diagrams animate quite well. This lets the reader walk through the sequence at their own pace, and provides additional opportunity for the author to explain steps in details.

    Yes the example is weird but it comes from the Mermaid [documentation](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/sequenceDiagram?id=sequencenumbers)

    The [original version](https://observablehq.com/@tomlarkworthy/animated-sequence-diagrams@109) of this notebook just used the `?` operator against the `step` value on the mermaid source code to create the animation effect. This annoyed people because the source was very messy, but then [@mootari](/@mootari) helpfully donated the following helper: 
  </script>
  <script id="158" type="application/vnd.observable.javascript" pinned="">
    function steppedMermaid(index, markup) {
      const steps = markup.split(/\n\s*%% *step *%% *\n/).slice(0, index + 1);
      const n = steps.length - 1;
      if(n > 0) steps[n] = `rect rgb(0, 255, 0)\n${steps[n]}\nend\n`;
      return mermaid`${steps.join('\n')}`;
    }
  </script>
  <script id="166" type="text/markdown">
    However, don't get hung up on the specifics of the helper. I imagine most deployments of this effect will need their set of own abstraction to help mutate the mermaid source, so don't feel restricted by it. You can highlight whatever boxes you like with rect! It's just string manipulation.
