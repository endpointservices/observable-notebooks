Or, use the [Observable Runtime](https://github.com/observablehq/runtime) to
import this module directly into your application. To npm install:

import {Runtime, Inspector} from "@observablehq/runtime";
import define from "@tomlarkworthy/building-a-team-chore-app";

To log the value of the cell named “foo”:

~~~js
const runtime = new Runtime();
const main = runtime.module(define);
main.value("foo").then(value => console.log(value));
~~~
